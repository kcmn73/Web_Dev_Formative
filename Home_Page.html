  <h1>What is Climate Change? Why is it an issue?</h1> 
  
  <p>    
    Climate is just the typical and normal weather is a specific geographical location over a lomng period of time.  
    By no surprise, it is normal for different places to have different average temperature. It is beacsue of this that
    it is unfortunate that this movement was hindered by the name "global warming". A common argument raised by those
    na√Øve to what the real issue is say, "It is still cold in country. We've had stronger snow storms than ever before". 
    While this is true, and no one is denying it, the real issue is "climate change". 
  </p>
  <p>
    While the climate is by no means static, what climate change is really trying to tackle is the unnatural human-caused 
    rapid alteration of our environment. This is due to a a veriety of factors, some of which include 
    the use of oil, gas and coal as a main energy source. It is used to heat homes, production plants and transport. 
    The issue with use of such energy sources is they are non-renewable, and when they are used, they produce greenhouse
    gasses as a biproduct. The gasses (the main culperate being carbon dioxide) cause the heat from the sun
    to stay trapped in the atmosphere, hence the name greenhouse gasses. Thus, an increasing global avreage of temperature. 
  </p>
<p>
    Now while it is not true it has gotten warmer everywhere yet, it is true that more extreme climate events are
    becoming more and more common. We are seeing more droughts, more hurruicanes, more cyclones, more typhoons, more floods,
    more dust storms, more fires, more blizzards...
</p>
<p>
    The list goes on.
</p>
<p>
    The effects are also innumerable.
    Millions of deaths around the globe from drought, inability to farm, destruction of entire cities from extreme weather,
    extinction and endangerment of species of animals...
</p>
<p>
    The list goes on. 
</p>
<p>
    Many of those who this website will reach are most likely in countries that have the luxary on still not being ovetly 
    affected by these issues. However, one thing we can be sure of is this will change. This is not a "poor people problem",
    this is a human problem. This is a global problem...
</p>
<p>
    and a problem that we must solve.
